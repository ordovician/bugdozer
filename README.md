This project is two things:

1. An experiment in using the Unix philosophy for development. Meaning the application is being developed as a collection of small executables cooperating.
2. A client for showing, editing and adding issues/bugs to a bug tracking system. First targeted system is JIRA.

With the Unix philosophy in mind the project will initially focus on text only unix tools. A Cocoa based OS X GUI client is planned for later.
